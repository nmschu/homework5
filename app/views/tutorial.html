<!--Intro to this section-->
<h1>Tutorial</h1>
<p>This is a step by step on how I went about creating the "Home" section of this site. Going from the top down, this is how you are able to do it as well, even if you don't have any angular knowledge.</p>

<br>
<br>

<!-- Step 1 - how to download packages -->
<h3><b>Starting the site</b></h3>
<p>To start the site, you need to get a few things installed on your machine. I have a Mac, so all information given will be using a Mac for the example. But before we get too much into it, we need to download a few things.</p>

<!--How to install NPM-->
<h4>NPM Install</h4>
<p>NPM comes bundled in with node. So <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">here</a> is a link to download it. Choose the mature and dependable version. At time of writing this, that is version 4.3.0 LTS.</p>
<p>NPM is a package manager. Once this is installed, you can open terminal and type in a few words, and it will automatically download the other packages we need.</p>
<!--How to install Bower-->
<h4>Bower Install</h4>
<p>On the command line, type in:<b> npm install -g bower</b></p>
<!--Hpw to install Grunt-->
<h4>Grunt Install</h4>
<p>On the command line, type in: <b> npm install -g grunt-cli</b></p>
<!--How to install Yeoman-->
<h4>Yeoman Install</h4>
<p>On the command line, type in:<b> npm install -g yo</b></p>
<!--How to get the generators in-->
<h4>Getting the generators</h4>
<p>On the command line, type in:<b> npm imstall --global generator-angular@0.11.1 generator-karma</b></p>
<br>

<!--Step 2 - Scaffolding-->
<h3><b>Scaffolding</b></h3>
<p>Now that we have all that, we are able to use Yeoman to scaffold a website for us. This way, we dont have to do too much of the set up and connection of pages. After its set up we can customize it to our heart's desire, but for now, we will leave it as it is.</p>
<!--Build folder and change directory-->
<h4>Set up</h4>
<p>Before we let Yeoman build it for us, we need to make a folder to put everything in. Create a folder on your desktop and name it whatever you want. Then, on the command line, type in: <b>cd ["Folder Name"]</b>. Now we are in the correct directory, and when we run Yeoman, all the files will be saved there.</p>
<!--Using Yeoman to build the site for you-->
<h4>Creating the site</h4>
<p>Now that we are in the correct directory (the folder you just made), lets let Yeoman build it for us. On the command line, type in <b>yo</b>. It will ask you to select a generator. We are going to be building it in angular, so hit enter. Next, it is going to ask you some questions on how you want it set up, we will <b>NOT</b> be using Sass (with Compass), we <b>WILL</b> be using Grunt, and also using Bootstrap.</p>
<p>After that, it asks which modules you would like to include. Deselect them all (use the arrow keys to navigate, and the space bar to select/deselect), then hit enter. It will take a few minutes, then you will have a website built for you. You hardly had to do anything!</p>
<br>

<!--Step 3 - Angular-->
<h3><b>Angular</b></h3>
<p>Time for the Angular (.jay esssssssssss)! Bring in the tutorial.json file, and save it in the premade site. I saved mine in the controllers folder (app/scripts/controller). This file is where all our data is coming from. In the main.js file in the same folder, we need to have this code in there : <b>angular.module('homework5App')
  .controller('MainCtrl', ['$http', function($http){
    var main = this;
  	$http.get('scripts/controllers/tutorials.json').success(function(data){
      main.tutInfo=data;
    });
  }]);
</b></p>
<p>What this does, is calls the file through the http server build in with Angular. This controller is called <b>MainCtrl</b>, which we will need to know later.</p>
<!--Set up the controller-->
<h4>Setting up the controller</h4>
<p>To set up the controller so it works nicely with the rest of the program, we need to go in the index.html file, then type in <b>ng-controller="MainCtrl as tutorial"</b> in the div on line 51.</p>
<!--Display the contents-->
<h4>Now display the contents</h4>
<p>We now go into the main.html file, then create a div there. In index.html, we attached the controller, so we are good there. In this file (main.html), we need to put <b>ng-repeat="tutorial in tutorial.tutInfo</b> into the div. This is what allows it to repeat itself.</p>
<p>Last thing to do is bring the information in and display what is in each section of the .json file. This is the simplest of the steps. We type in <b>((tutorial.author))</b> (which is how I typed it in, but the syntax is <b>((controllerAlias.itemInJson)) </b> for angular) which will list all the authors in the .json file. Everything is all synced up and working nciely with each other, all thats left to do is style it!</p>
<p><b>NOTE: above I typed in (( and )) but when using Angular, replace those with curley braces { and }, I could not display them that way because angular was trying to read it, causing it not to appear for me.</b></p>
